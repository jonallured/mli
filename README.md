# mli

This gem wraps the [Monolithium][] API and provides CLI and classes to make
working with that API nice.

## Installation

For now I'm just installing it locally. To do that first clone the repo and then
have rake install it:

```bash
rake install
```

And that's it! Upgrading is the same.

> [!NOTE]
> This will install to the current Ruby so keep in mind that other Rubies could
> have an older version or no version at all.
